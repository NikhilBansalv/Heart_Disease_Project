## Introduction

Briefly describe the project purpose. For example:

> This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict an individual's risk of heart disease using patient data (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol). The goal is to support early diagnosis and timely intervention in clinical settings.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and normalizing raw clinical data.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying key predictors such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of algorithms like logistic regression and random forests.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- **Deployment:** A user-friendly web interface for risk prediction.

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to set up the project locally. For example:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git

# Change directory
cd heart-disease-prediction

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
